1) Slide.type changed to Slide.slide_type because type is a reserved keyword

2) Modified the schema diagram to reflect change 1) and rearranged field orders

3) Slide.slide_number starts at 1, 2, 3...

[bonus ?]

4) SurveyOption.option_number starts at 1, 2....

5) We assume Session is created_at the time of presentation
