[if you're on Linux/Vagarant]
sudo -u postgres psql postgres

[if you're on Windows/Mac]
psql postgres

[from psql]
postgres=# CREATE USER ballotbox_admin CREATEDB PASSWORD 'slides';
postgres=# \q

[NOTE: the username 'ballotbox_admin' and password 'slides' are hard-coded
in Rakefile and config/database.rb. You need to modify them if you set your own username/password on your PostgreSQL server]


===========================================

[Don't run these unless the above doesn't work]

sudo -u postgres psql postgres
# \password postgres
Enter new password: 

[enter 'postgres' without the quotes]

Enter it again: 
postgres=# \q

Change the username/password in ./Rakefile and ./config/database.rb to 'postgres' and 'postgres'
